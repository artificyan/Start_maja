# Introduction

MAJA stands for Maccs-Atcor Joint Algorithm. This atmospheric correction and cloud screening software is based [on MACCS processor](http://www.cesbio.ups-tlse.fr/multitemp/?p=6203), developped for CNES by CS-SI company, from a method and a prototype developped at CESBIO, <sup>[1](#ref1)</sup> <sup>[2](#ref2)</sup> <sup>[3](#ref3)</sup>. Recently, thanks to an agreement between CNES and DLR and to some funding from ESA, we started adding methods from DLR 's atmospheric correction software ATCOR into MACCS. MACCS then became MAJA. The current distributed version is the first version resulting from this collaboration : MAJA V1-0. 

MAJA has a very unique feature among all atmospheric correction processors : it uses multi-temporal criteria to improve cloud detection and aerosol retrieval. Because of this feature, it is important to use MAJA to process *time series* of images and not single images. Moreover, these images have to be processed chronologically. To initialise processing of a time series, a special mode is used, named "backward mode". To get a correct first product, we process in fact a small number of products in anti-chronological order (default value of number of images processed in backward mode is 8, but consider increasing it if your region is very cloudy). Then all the products are processed in "nominal" mode and chronological order. When a product is fully or nearly fully cloudy, it is not issued to save processing time and disk space.

For more information about MAJA methods but without details, please read : http://www.cesbio.ups-tlse.fr/multitemp/?p=6203
To get all details on the methods, MAJA's ATBD is available here : http://tully.ups-tlse.fr/olivier/maja_atbd/blob/master/atbd_maja.pdf, or reference <sup>[1](#ref4)</sup>, below.

Following discovery of errors in previous version, we went through all the files and found other updates to make. If most files have been updated, differences in the results are quite small (<0.001 in reflectance) compared to results obtained from version 0.9.

We have also set-up [an internal repository](http://tully.ups-tlse.fr/olivier/gipp/tree/master) containing parameters for all sensors actually processed by MAJA, including VenÂµs and LANDSAT 8. This repository will be updated more frequently. 

## Recent changes
### v0.9 (2017/10/02)
- this version of start_maja works with both S2A and S2B
- we have found errors, especially regarding water vapour, in the parameters we provided in the "GIPP_nominal" folder. These parameters have been removed and we strongly advise you to do the same.
- we have updated the parameters and provided them for both S2A and S2B in the folder GIPP_S2AS2B

### v.0.9.1 (2018/03/29)
Added MAJA error catching. As a result, the processing of a whole time series stops if MAJA fails for a given date.

### V1 (2018/05/xx)
Within a few days, we will release start_maja V1, to go along with MAJA 3.1. The input and output format will be slightly different, as we had so far two formats, one for the products generated at Theia, and one for the products generated by MAJA used with standard ESA l1C products. We have omogeneised these two formats and adopted that of Theia. It will cause some difficulties to users of the previous versions of MAJA, as they will need to adapt to the new output format and will also need to start an initialisation procedure again. Users notwanting to make the adaptation can keep on using MAJA V1.0.

MAJA 3.1 ships several improvements, the main of which is the used of Copernicus atmopshere Monitoring Service aerosol products, which are used to constrain the aerosol type in the estimates. This brings a major improvement in places where the aerosols can differ from a continental model which was used so far. 

It also includes a correction for thin cirrus clouds and a directional effect correction used to improve the estimate of AOT.


## Data format 
MAJA's native output data format is explained in the document "user, installation and operating manual ([MU] SETG-MU-MAJA-010-CS.pdf)", in the document folder downloaded with MAJA). A simplified explanation of the format is provided here: http://www.cesbio.ups-tlse.fr/multitemp/?page_id=10464

# Test maja with the test data set
## Get MAJA Sofware
MAJA can be downloaded as a binary code from https://logiciels.cnes.fr/en/content/maja
It is provided as a binary code and compiled for *Linux Red Hat and CentOS versions 6 and 7 only*. Its licence prevents commercial use of the code. For a licence allowing commercial use, please contact CNES (Olivier Hagolle).

## install MAJA
This is explained in the documentation provided with MAJA software.
Some users have had issues with some missing libraries, depending on how the linux system is configured. Running the following commands, with administration rights, might help.
```
# sudo yum --disableplugin=fastestmirror -y update (if necessary)
sudo yum --disableplugin=fastestmirror -y install gd libxslt libxml2
```

## Test MAJA with a test data_set
We provide a test data set, to verify your installation of MAJA. You might want to skip this phase, and try to use MAJA directly with start_maja.py, and only follow these steps if issues are found with MAJA. In that case, please download the following pacakge and follow the provided documentation.

# Basic Supervisor for MAJA processor

The basic supervisor **start_maja** enables to process successively all files in a time series of Sentinel-2 images for a given tile, stored in a folder. The initialisation of the time series is performed with the "backward mode", and then all the dates are processed in "nominal" mode. The backward mode takes much more time than the nominal mode. On my computer, which is a fast one, the nominal mode takes 15 minutes, backward mode takes almost one hour. No control is done on the outputs, and it does not check if the time elapsed between two successive products used as input is not too long and would require restarting the initialisation in backward mode.


To use this start_maja.py, you will need to configure the directories within the folder.txt file.

## Download Sentinel-2 data :
The use of peps_download.py to download Sentinel-2 l1c PRODUCTS is recommended :
https://github.com/olivierhagolle/peps_download

## Parameters
The tool needs a lot of configuration files which are provided in two directories "userconf" and "GIPP_S2AS2B". I tend to never change the "userconf", but the GIPP_S2AS2B contains the parameters and look-up tables, which you might want to change. Most of the parameters lie within the L2COMM file. When I want to test different sets of parameters, I create a new GIPP folder, which I name GIPP_context, where *context* is passed as a parameter of the command line with option -c . 

## Folder structure
To run MAJA, you need to store all the necessary data in an input folder. Here is an example of its content in nominal mode.

The .SAFE file is the input product. THE L2VALD files are the L2A product, which is the result from a previous execution  of MAJA. The files with GIP are parameter files for S2A and S2B, that you will find in this repository. The REFDE2 files are the DTM files. How to obtain them is explained below. 

A "userconf" folder is also necessary, but it is also provided in this repository.



## DTM
A DTM folder is needed to process data with MAJA. Of course, it depends on the tile you want to process. This DTM must be stored in the DTM folder, which is defined within the code. A tool exists to create this DTM, it is available here : http://tully.ups-tlse.fr/olivier/prepare_mnt

An example of DTM file is available here for tile 31TFJ in Provence, France, near Avignon. Both files should be placed in a folder named DTM/S2__TEST_AUX_REFDE2_T31TFJ_0001 in the start_maja directory.


http://osr-cesbio.ups-tlse.fr/echangeswww/majadata//S2__TEST_AUX_REFDE2_T31TFJ_0001.DBL

http://osr-cesbio.ups-tlse.fr/echangeswww/majadata//S2__TEST_AUX_REFDE2_T31TFJ_0001.HDR

The DBL file is a tar file (I am innocent for this choice...) that can be opened with `tar xvf `. MAJA can use both the archive or un-archived version. My tool above does not provide the archived version.

# Example workflow

Here is how to process a set of data above tile 31TFJ, near Avignon in Provence, France. To process any other tile, you will need to prepare the DTM and store the data in the DTM folder.

## Install

- Install MAJA

- Clone the current repository to get start_maja.py
`git clone https://github.com/olivierhagolle/Start_maja`

## Retrieve Sentinel-2 L1C data.
- For instance, with peps_download.py (you need to have registered at https://peps.cnes.fr and store the account and password in peps.txt file.

`python ./peps_download.py -c S2ST -l 'Avignon' -a peps.txt -d 2017-01-01 -f 2017-04-01 -w /path/to/L1C_DATA/Avignon`

- I tend to store the data per site. A given site can contain several tiles. All the L1C tiles corresponding to a site are stored in a directory named /path/to/L1C_DATA/Site

- Unzip the LIC files in /path/to/L1C_DATA/Avignon

## Create DTM
Follow DTM generation instructions : http://tully.ups-tlse.fr/olivier/prepare_mnt

## Execute start_maja.py

- To use the start_maja script, you need to configure the directories, within the folder.txt file.
Here is my own configuration, also provided in the folders.txt file in this repository.
```
repCode=/mnt/data/home/hagolleo/PROG/S2/lance_maja
repWork=/mnt/data/SENTINEL2/MAJA
repL1  =/mnt/data/SENTINEL2/L1C_PDGS
repL2  =/mnt/data/SENTINEL2/L2A_MAJA
repMaja=/mnt/data/home/petruccib/Install-MAJA/maja/core/1.0/bin/maja
```
- repCode is where Start_maja.py is stored, together with the DTM, userconf and GIPP directories
- repWork is a directory to store the temporary files
- repL1 is where to find the L1C data (without the site name which is added aferward)
  - Les produits SAFE doivent donc Ãªtre stockÃ©s Ã  l'emplacement suivant : repL1  = repL1/site
- repL2 is for the L2A data (without the site name which is added aferward)
- repMAJA is where the Maja binary code is

Here is an example of command line
```
Usage   : python ./start_maja.py -f <folder_file>-c <context> -t <tile name> -s <Site Name> -d <start date>
Example : python ./start_maja.py -f folders.txt -c MAJA_1_0_S2AS2B_NATIF -t 31TFJ -s Avignon -d 20170101
```
Description of command line options :
-f provides the folders filename
-c is the context, MAJA uses the GIPP files contained in GIPP_context directory. The L2A products will be created in 
rep_L2/Site/Tile/Context (Several users told me it is weird to use the GIPP folder name after removing GIPP_, I should change that)
-t is the tile number
-s is the site name
-d (aaaammdd) is the first date to process within the time series

Caution, *when a product has more than 90% of clouds, the L2A is not issued*. However, a folder with _NOTVALD_ is created.

## Known Errors

If you see this message : "ERROR 1:  Not a TIFF file, bad magic number 0 (0x0) ", don't worry, it is just a message sent by gdal, that has no consequence. We will try to catch it in next versions...

Some Sentinel-2 L1C products lack the angle information which is required by MAJA. In this case, MAJA stops processing with an error message. This causes issues particularly in the backward mode. These products were acquired in February and March 2016 and have not been reprocessed by ESA (despited repeated asks from my side). You should remove them from the folder which contains the list of L1C products to process.

# Docker

DÃ¡niel KristÃ³f provided us with a Dockerfile (Thank you DÃ¡niel), which, on any linux system retrieves the CentOS System, installs what is necessary and configures MAJA. I am really not a Docker expert, and when I tried, my system engineer immedialtely told me that there are some securities issues with Docker...

But if we follow Daniel's guidelines :

- First, download the test data set and store them in ~/MAJA/S2_NOMINAL
- Then configure the folders.txt file according to your configuration
- Then :
```
sudo docker build -t maja .

(or behind a proxy)
sudo docker build -t maja --build-arg http_proxy=$http_proxy --build-arg https_proxy=$https_proxy --build-arg ftp_proxy=$ftp_proxy .
```
And then, you may run MAJA with the test data sets with
```
sudo docker run -v ~/maja/S2_NOMINAL:/data maja /opt/maja/core/1.0/bin/maja -i /data/input_maja1.0 -o /data/output_maja1.0 -m L2NOMINAL -ucs /data/userconf --TileId 36JTT

```
